# TF2 Bot

This is a small bot that can automatically scrap weapons into metal and combine metal.
It can also assist the user in basic Steam trading.
All output is handled by Robot.class, emulating keystrokes and clicks of a real user.

This app is written in Java.

## Development

I am developing this bot using [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html).
I have committed the project files to allow others to easily open and try the project.

I'm a one-man team right now, working on this in my (very limited) free time.  Development is anticipated to be slow.

## Warnings

This bot is *extremely* rough and unpolished as of now.  Use this tool at your own risk!

Please do not use this bot without first reading the source and understanding how it will execute.

Future development might allow for features such as limiting which items get scrapped,
but that is not the case right now.
